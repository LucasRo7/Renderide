//! Bounded FIFO ring shared between the main (producer) and driver (consumer) threads.
//!
//! A single [`std::sync::Mutex`] guards the deque. Two [`std::sync::Condvar`]s separate
//! wake-up reasons: `space_available` wakes the producer when the consumer drains a slot,
//! `message_ready` wakes the consumer when the producer pushes a slot. Capacity is set by
//! the caller (see [`RING_CAPACITY`] in [`super`]).
//!
//! The ring also tracks consumer liveness so [`BoundedRing::push`] cannot block forever
//! after the driver thread has exited (cleanly or via panic). The consumer-side guard
//! pattern in [`super::worker`] flips the flag and broadcasts on the producer condvar from
//! its `Drop`.
