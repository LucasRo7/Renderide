//! Post-processing stack framework: trait, signature, and graph wiring helpers.
//!
//! Effects are inserted between the world-mesh forward HDR producer
//! ([`crate::passes::WorldMeshForwardOpaquePass`]) and the displayable target blit
//! ([`crate::passes::SceneColorComposePass`]). Each effect registers a subgraph on
//! the builder whose head samples one HDR float texture and whose tail writes another; the
//! [`PostProcessChain`] allocates the ping-pong HDR slots and wires edges between effects. Most
//! effects contribute a single raster pass (ACES tonemap); a few (GTAO, bloom) register a
//! multi-pass subgraph terminating in a single composite/apply pass.
//!
//! See [`crate::passes::post_processing`] for concrete effect implementations:
//! [`GtaoEffect`](crate::passes::post_processing::GtaoEffect),
//! [`BloomEffect`](crate::passes::post_processing::BloomEffect), and
//! [`AcesTonemapPass`](crate::passes::post_processing::AcesTonemapPass).
