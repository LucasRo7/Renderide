//! [`PostProcessEffect`] trait and identity enum used by [`super::PostProcessChain`].
//!
//! Effects are render passes with a stable identity that read one HDR float texture and write
//! another. They are added to the chain in execution order; each enabled effect contributes one
//! pass whose input is the previous effect's output (or the forward HDR target for the first one)
//! and whose output is the next ping-pong slot (or the chain's final output for the last one).
