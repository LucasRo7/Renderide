//! Null fallback material: model-space 3D checkerboard with world-space cell spacing.
//!
//! Build emits two targets from this file via [`MULTIVIEW`](https://docs.rs/naga_oil) shader defs:
//! - `null_default.wgsl` — `MULTIVIEW` off (single-view desktop)
//! - `null_multiview.wgsl` — `MULTIVIEW` on (stereo `@builtin(view_index)`)
//!
//! Used when the host shader has no embedded target or pipeline build fails.
//! Model-space projection (not UV-based) so the pattern is visible regardless
//! of mesh UV quality — mirrors `Null.shader` in `Resonite.UnityShaders`.
//!
//! The checker pattern is anchored to the model's local coordinate frame (so it
//! moves and rotates with the object), but cell spacing is derived from the
//! per-axis world-space scale extracted from the model matrix. This means a
//! mesh authored at any scale (centimeters, meters, arbitrary units) shows
//! cells of consistent physical size — `CELL_SIZE_WORLD` meters per cell.
//! Without this normalization, a fixed cells-per-object-space-unit constant
//! produces invisibly small or invisibly large cells across the wide range of
//! mesh authoring conventions in Resonite content.
//!
//! Imports `renderide::globals` so composed targets declare the full `@group(0)`
//! frame bind layout that the renderer enforces in reflection; `retain_globals_additive`
//! keeps each binding referenced after naga-oil import pruning.
//! [`PerDrawUniforms`] lives in [`renderide::per_draw`].
